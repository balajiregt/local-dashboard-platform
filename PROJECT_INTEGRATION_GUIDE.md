## üéØ Quick Setup

### Option 1: Install CLI Tool (Recommended)

The easiest way to start sending reports from your project:

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI tool globally
npm install -g ./cli

# 2. Initialize in your project
cd /path/to/your/playwright/project
npx playwright-reports init --repo your-username/your-repo

# 3. Run your tests with tracing
npx playwright test --trace=on

# 4. Upload results to dashboard
npx playwright-reports upload
```

### Option 2: Copy CLI into Your Project

```bash
# Copy the CLI package into your project
cp -r /Users/bky13/Desktop/local_dashboard_platform/cli ./tools/playwright-reports
cd ./tools/playwright-reports
npm install
npm run build

# Add to your package.json scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:upload": "npm run test && node ./tools/playwright-reports/dist/cli.js upload",
    "test:trace": "npx playwright test --trace=on"
  }
}
```

## üîß Integration Options

### A. GitHub Integration (Team Dashboard)

**Best for:** Teams, CI/CD, permanent dashboard hosting

1. **Setup GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Create a new repo for your dashboard or use existing
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-test-dashboard.git
   cd your-test-dashboard
   
   # Copy dashboard files
   cp -r /Users/bky13/Desktop/local_dashboard_platform/frontend/* .
   cp -r /Users/bky13/Desktop/local_dashboard_platform/cli ./tools/
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Select "Deploy from branch: gh-pages"
   - Your dashboard will be at `https://your-username.github.io/your-test-dashboard`

3. **Setup CLI in Your Playwright Project**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/playwright/project
   npm install -g ./tools/playwright-reports-cli
   
   # Initialize with your dashboard repo
   playwright-reports init --repo your-username/your-test-dashboard
   ```

### B. Local Development Integration

**Best for:** Local development, quick debugging, private setups

1. **Copy Dashboard to Your Project**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/playwright/project
   
   # Create dashboard directory
   mkdir playwright-dashboard
   cp -r /Users/bky13/Desktop/local_dashboard_platform/* ./playwright-dashboard/
   
   # Add to .gitignore if you don't want to commit
   echo "playwright-dashboard/data/" >> .gitignore
   echo "playwright-dashboard/frontend/public/mock-data/reports/" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Add Scripts to package.json**
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "test:dashboard": "cd playwright-dashboard && npm run start",
       "test:process": "cd playwright-dashboard && node tools/process-real-traces.js",
       "test:upload": "npm run test:trace && npm run test:process",
       "test:trace": "npx playwright test --trace=on --output-dir=./playwright-dashboard/data"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run Tests and View Dashboard**
   ```bash
   # Run tests with traces
   npm run test:trace
   
   # Process and start dashboard
   npm run test:upload
   npm run test:dashboard
   
   # View at http://localhost:3000
   ```

---

## üè† Local Development Setup

### For Your Existing Playwright Project

1. **Update playwright.config.ts**
   ```typescript
   import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
   
   export default defineConfig({
     // ... your existing config
     
     // Enhanced trace collection
     use: {
       trace: 'retain-on-failure',
       screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
       video: 'retain-on-failure',
     },
     
     // Output to dashboard data directory
     outputDir: './playwright-dashboard/data',
     
     // Enhanced reporting
     reporter: [
       ['html'],
       ['json', { outputFile: './playwright-dashboard/data/results.json' }],
     ],
   });
   ```

2. **Create Integration Script**
   ```typescript
   // scripts/upload-traces.ts
   import { spawn } from 'child_process';
   import { existsSync } from 'fs';
   
   async function uploadTraces() {
     if (!existsSync('./playwright-dashboard/data')) {
       console.log('No trace data found');
       return;
     }
     
     // Process traces
     await runCommand('node', ['./playwright-dashboard/tools/process-real-traces.js']);
     
     // Start dashboard (optional)
     console.log('Dashboard available at: http://localhost:3000');
     await runCommand('npm', ['run', 'start'], { cwd: './playwright-dashboard/frontend' });
   }
   
   function runCommand(cmd: string, args: string[], options?: any): Promise<void> {
     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       const child = spawn(cmd, args, { stdio: 'inherit', ...options });
       child.on('close', (code) => code === 0 ? resolve() : reject());
     });
   }
   
   uploadTraces().catch(console.error);
   ```

3. **Add NPM Scripts**
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "test:debug": "npx playwright test --trace=on --headed",
       "test:ci": "npx playwright test --trace=retain-on-failure",
       "dashboard:process": "ts-node scripts/upload-traces.ts",
       "dashboard:start": "cd playwright-dashboard/frontend && npm start",
       "dashboard:view": "npm run dashboard:process && npm run dashboard:start"
     }
   }
   ```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Data Processing

```typescript
// scripts/custom-processor.ts
import { TraceProcessor } from './playwright-dashboard/cli/src/trace-processor';
import { ProcessedTestReport } from './playwright-dashboard/cli/src/types';

class CustomTraceProcessor extends TraceProcessor {
  async processTestResults(): Promise<ProcessedTestReport> {
    const report = await super.processTestResults();
    
    // Add custom metadata
    report.execution.metadata = {
      ...report.execution.metadata,
      projectName: 'My Awesome Project',
      team: 'QA Team',
      release: process.env.RELEASE_VERSION || 'dev',
      customMetrics: await this.calculateCustomMetrics(report),

  }
  
  private async calculateCustomMetrics(report: ProcessedTestReport) {
    return {
      averageTestDuration: report.results.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.duration, 0) / report.results.length,
      failureRate: (report.summary.failed / report.summary.total) * 100,
      regressionTests: report.results.filter(r => r.testName.includes('regression')).length,
    };
  }
}

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No test results found"**
   ```bash
   # Check output directory
   ls -la test-results/
   
   # Verify playwright config

   # Verify GitHub Pages
   # Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages in your repo
   ```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable debug logging
DEBUG=playwright-reports:* playwright-reports upload

# Dry run to see what would be uploaded
playwright-reports upload --dry-run
```
